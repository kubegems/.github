## Hi. This is OpenGems Project News！ 👋

We deeply appreciate your ongoing attention and support for KubeGems. After careful consideration, we have decided to make significant decisions for the continuous development and more focused positioning of our product in the future.

Firstly, KubeGems will be renamed to OpenGems. This change in name reflects our continuous pursuit of openness and innovation, and also heralds the next phase of development for our product.

Secondly, KubeGems, now known as OpenGems, as a subsidiary product, will focus on inheriting and optimizing the management functions of Kubernetes cluster. At the same time, we will launch new independent projects, focusing on areas such as Observability, Edge, and MLOps, to achieve more refined management and control.

Lastly,  due to human resource constraints, we will no longer maintain the service mesh module based on Istio. We deeply regret the inconvenience this may cause to users who rely on this module.  we will soon release v1.24! 🎁

The new OpenGems contains the following modules

- **KubeGems**: is a Multi-tenant management platform based on Kubernetes, which has supported tens of thousands of containers in stable operation right now.
- **ObserGems**: An OpenTelemetry-based cloud-native observability platform for infrastructure monitoring, application performance, tracing, and application performance.
- **EdgeGems**: A platform that supports managing edge clusters by k3s and executing batch deployment tasks.
- **AIGems**: A Cloud-native & high-performance machine learning platform. Include LLM training、 modelHub and inference.
- **GemsHub**: A lightweight repository service containing applications (helm packaged), AI models, datasets, and community operations features.

Any issues about KubeGems can be sumbit on GitHub,and We will solve it as soon as possible.
